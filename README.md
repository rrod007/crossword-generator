# Crossword Generator

Crossword generator takes as input an empty crossword template and a set of words, both in .txt format, and outputs the same template (printed to the console or optionally saved as an image) filled with words from the set of words.


## Example usage

```bash
python generate.py data/structure1.txt data/words1.txt output.png
```

This will fill the template at data/structure1.txt with words from data/words1.txt and store an image output at output.png
